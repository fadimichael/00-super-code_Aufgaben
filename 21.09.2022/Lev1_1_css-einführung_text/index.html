    <h1>When will that be?</h1>
    <p>Yes! In your face, Gandhi! I'm sure those windmills will keep them cool. We can't compete with Mom! Her company is big and evil! Ours is small and neutral! Stop! Don't shoot fire stick in space canoe! Cause explosive decompression!</p>
    <p>Hey, guess what you're accessories to. I am Singing Wind, Chief of the Martians. Spare me your space age technobabble, Attila the Hun! <strong> Too much work.</strong> <em> Let's burn it and say we dumped it in the sewer.</em> Kif might!</p>

    <p>Goodbye, cruel world. Goodbye, cruel lamp. Goodbye, cruel velvet drapes, lined with what would appear to be some sort of cruel muslin and the cute little pom-pom curtain pull cords. Cruel though they may beâ€¦ Bender, being God isn't easy. If you do too much, people get dependent on you, and if you do nothing, they lose hope. You have to use a light touch. Like a safecracker, or a pickpocket.</p>

        <li>Oh dear! She's stuck in an infinite loop, and he's an idiot! Well, that's love for you.</li>
